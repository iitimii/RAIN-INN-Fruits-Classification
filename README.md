# RAIN-INN-Fruits-Classification
A deep learning project by the RAIN-INN community focused on accurately classifying various types of fruits, transfer learning, data augmentation, and image processing.

We'll be working on a fruit classification project. We'll build our own custom neural network and also fine-tune ResNet to compare the scores. You'll learn about convolutions, image processing, transfer learning, data augmentation, and CNN hyperparameters.

Please go through the following resources before Saturday to ensure you're up to speed:

- Dataset: [Download Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/fruits-classification)

Sure, here's the complete description addressing the community:

## Steps:

1. Data Gathering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Processing
4. Model Building
5. Model Training
6. Model Cross Validation
7. Model Deployment - If we have time, we'll deploy using FastAPI and Streamlit

Some advanced steps include:
- Data Ingestion
- Data Versioning
- Setting up CI/CD/CT pipeline
- Experiment Tracking
- Monitoring

But we'll skip those for now.
